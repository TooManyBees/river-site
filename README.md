# Netlify + Dropbox client site

Based almost completely on jimniels's [netlibox](https://github.com/jimniels/netlibox/) template, with modifications:

* lambda function verifies the Dropbox signature before triggering build (were we... were we just gonna go on honor system here???)
* no NPM needed
    * the lambda function, is valid Node 8 LTS
    * fetching dropbox content is done in ruby, since we're using it for Jekyll anyway
    * thank heavens
* downloaded pages will clobber duplicate files that already exist in the repo, even if they have different extensions like `.md` and `.markdown`. (The list of extensions is defined in `dropbox.rb`'s `POST_EXTNAMES` constant.)

# Setup

Firstly, there is nothing special happening in `./app`. It contains a Jekyll new site boilerplate, with the exception of `_config.yml`, `Gemfile`, and `Gemfile.lock` that remain in the top level directory.

The only change of consequence in `_config.yml` is the line
```yaml
source: "./app"
```

In Dropbox:

1. https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps → **Create App**
2. Pick Dropbox API, limit to App Folder
3. **App secret** → **Show**, save for later as `DROPBOX_APP_SECRET`
4. **OAuth2** → **Allow Implicit Grants** → **Disallow**
5. **OAuth2** → **Generate access token**, save for later as `DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`

In source code:

1. Consider renaming `functions/dropbox-webhook.js` because Netlify will mount it at a predictable path based on its file name, and that would allow someone to maliciously use up your monthly Function quota.

In Netlify:

1. Create a Git-based app (otherwise it will not support build hooks)
2. Go to (on top nav) **Settings** → **Build & Deploy** → **Continuous Deployment**
3. **Build hooks** → **Add Build Hook**, name it anything (`dropbox-webhook` is good), save generated url for later as `NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK_URL`
4. In **Build environment variables** → **Edit variables**, create these variables with the values saved from earlier
    1. `DROPBOX_APP_SECRET`
    2. `DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`
    3. `NETLIFY_BUILD_HOOK_URL`
5. Go to (on top nav) **Functions**. It may take a while to populate the list of functions after initial deploy.
6. Go to function `dropbox-webhook.js` (unless you renamed it), copy the **Endpoint** url, save for later

Back in Dropbox app settings:

1. **Webhooks** → **Add**, with the function url you just saved. Its status should quickly change to *Enabled*. If not, look in the Netlify function log (on the page that lists its URL) and check if the function is being invoked at all. It should look like:
    ```
    8:07:43 AM: dropbox-webhook invoked
    8:07:43 AM: Echoing challenge 2_mLAgJwloCKup6nTktFXFA131c2ycyJmjtzd_Rc9HY
    ```
